You can find my CV in this repository. It is available in two languages: 
[English](https://yag000.github.io/cv/cv-english.pdf) and [French](https://yag000.github.io/cv/cv-french.pdf) (not updated often).
The source code is written in LaTeX and the PDF files are uploaded to a web page automatically using GitHub Actions.
